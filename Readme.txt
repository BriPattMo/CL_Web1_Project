This project is the landing page for a non-profit MMA training facility. 
The landing page focuses on giving a breif overview of the classes offered and has link placeholders
in the navigation bar where the site can be updated to include more information at a later date.

Though not as indepth or lofty as I planned, the site does include the needed 3 features for mvp:
1: Aresponsive navigation bar that incorporates Javascript
2: A run spped of over 60 from pagespeed.web.developers
 --screenshots from test located in images folder (hopefully the addition doesn't slow site down)
3: Transition animation to an element on hover
 --Button at bottom of the page enlarges and changes upon hover

Multiple media queries are also present
